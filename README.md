# 🎨 AI Image Generator

This is a simple web application that generates AI-based images from text prompts using the [Pollinations AI API](https://image.pollinations.ai/). The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and allows users to enter a text prompt to view a generated image.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and responsive UI
- Realtime image generation using external AI API
- Error handling for empty input and failed requests
- Styled with custom CSS
